        As well as being a designer I spend a lot of my time engaged in one of
        my many interests, story telling. Story telling always played a huge
        part of my design process so it only felt natural to want to write my
        own stories. Mammals Moo issue one is the first book in a series of
        short story collections both written and designed by me.
